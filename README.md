This is the readme file for the final project in the Programming and Scripting module
The project is concerned with the well-known **Fisher's Iris data set**

Fisher's Iris data set, also known as the **Iris flower data set**, is a dataset that records the length and width measurements for sepals and petals for three distinct Iris species: *Iris setosa*, *Iris virginica* and *Iris versicolor*.




1. Research the data set online and write a summary about it in your README. - Week of **April 10th**
2. Download the data set and add it to your repository.                      - Week of **April 10th**
3. Write a program called analysis.py that:
    1. Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file,             - Week of **April 17th**
    2. Saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and                  - Week of **April 17th**
    3. Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables.                     - Week of **April 24th**
    4. Performs any other analysis you think is appropriate
